# File Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the file reorganization work completed to improve the project structure and test organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Coverage Analyzer Moved

**From:** `scripts/analyze_test_coverage.py`  
**To:** `tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py`

- **Reason:** Moved to tests directory to run as the last test automatically (zzz prefix ensures it runs last)
- **Functionality:** Analyzes test coverage of modules in src/ and project root
- **Usage:** 
  ```bash
  python tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py
  uv run python tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py
  ```

### 2. Test Runner Moved

**From:** `scripts/run_tests.py`  
**To:** `tests/run_tests.py`

- **Reason:** Better organization - test-related scripts belong in tests directory
- **Functionality:** Runs various test categories (yfinance, binance, polygon, parquet)
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  python tests/run_tests.py --interactive
  python tests/run_tests.py --docker
  python tests/run_tests.py --categories binance polygon
  ```

### 3. Stdio Test Moved

**From:** `scripts/test_stdio.py`  
**To:** `tests/test_stdio.py`

- **Reason:** Test script belongs in tests directory
- **Functionality:** Tests PyCharm GitHub Copilot MCP Server in stdio mode
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  python tests/test_stdio.py
  ```

### 4. Files Kept in Original Location

The following files were intentionally kept in `scripts/` directory:

- `scripts/auto_start_mcp.py` - Auto-start MCP server with intelligent detection
- `scripts/run_cursor_mcp.py` - Manual PyCharm GitHub Copilot MCP server runner

**Reason:** These are utility scripts, not tests, and serve different purposes.

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files

1. **docs/scripts.md**
   - Updated references to `tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py`

2. **docs/testing.md**
   - Updated references to `tests/run_tests.py`

3. **docs/mcp-servers/SETUP.md**
   - Updated references to `tests/test_stdio.py`

4. **docs/mcp-servers/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md**
   - Updated file reorganization history

5. **docker-entrypoint.sh**
   - Updated Docker container to use `tests/run_tests.py`

## Key Differences Between MCP Scripts

### auto_start_mcp.py vs run_cursor_mcp.py

**auto_start_mcp.py:**
- **Purpose:** Automatic MCP server starter with intelligent detection
- **Features:**
  - Detects running IDEs (Cursor, PyCharm)
  - Monitors project conditions and file changes
  - Automatically starts/stops servers based on conditions
  - Runs as a background daemon process
  - Health monitoring and auto-restart capabilities
  - CLI interface for manual control

**run_cursor_mcp.py:**
- **Purpose:** Manual PyCharm GitHub Copilot MCP server runner
- **Features:**
  - Manual server startup and testing
  - Comprehensive testing suite (startup, functionality, performance)
  - GitHub Copilot integration testing
  - Configuration validation and creation
  - Performance monitoring and reporting
  - IDE configuration generation

## Test Verification

Created `tests/test_file_reorganization.py` to verify:
- Files were moved to correct locations
- Old files were properly removed
- Documentation was updated
- Docker entrypoint was updated
- Existing functionality was preserved

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization:** Test-related scripts are now in the tests directory
2. **Automatic Execution:** Test coverage analyzer runs last with zzz prefix
3. **Clear Separation:** Utility scripts remain in scripts directory
4. **Updated Documentation:** All references point to correct locations
5. **Preserved Functionality:** No existing logic was broken

## Usage Examples

### Running Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
# From project root
python tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py

# With uv
uv run python tests/zzz_analyze_test_coverage.py
```

### Running Test Categories
```bash
# Interactive mode
python tests/run_tests.py --interactive

# Docker mode
python tests/run_tests.py --docker

# Specific categories
python tests/run_tests.py --categories binance polygon
```

### Testing MCP Server
```bash
# Stdio mode testing
python tests/test_stdio.py

# Auto-start server
python scripts/auto_start_mcp.py start

# Manual server runner
python scripts/run_cursor_mcp.py --test --report
```

## Conclusion

The file reorganization successfully:
- ✅ Moved test-related scripts to appropriate locations
- ✅ Updated all documentation references
- ✅ Preserved existing functionality
- ✅ Maintained clear separation between utilities and tests
- ✅ Improved project organization
- ✅ Added automatic test coverage analysis execution

All changes were made in English as requested, and no existing logic was broken.
