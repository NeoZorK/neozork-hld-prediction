# Emergency Restart Service Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented emergency restart service functionality for handling container deletion failures in the NeoZork HLD Prediction native container management system.

## Problem Solved

When running `./scripts/native-container/native-container.sh` and selecting "Stop Container", if the error occurs:
```
Error: internalError: "delete failed for one or more containers: ["neozork-hld-prediction"]"
[ERROR] Failed to remove container
[WARNING] Cleanup completed (some resources may remain)"
```

The system now shows the message:
```
Recommended emergency restart service, choose p4 "Restart service"
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Function: `restart_container_service()`

Added to `scripts/native-container/native-container.sh`:

```bash
# Function to restart container service
restart_container_service() {
    print_header "Restarting Container Service"
    echo
    
    print_status "Step 1: Stopping container system..."
    if container system stop; then
        print_success "Container system stopped"
    else
        print_warning "Container system stop may have failed or was already stopped"
    fi
    
    echo
    print_status "Step 2: Starting container system..."
    if container system start; then
        print_success "Container system started"
    else
        print_error "Failed to start container system"
        if [ -t 0 ]; then
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
        fi
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo
    print_status "Step 3: Checking container system status..."
    if container system status; then
        print_success "Container system is running"
    else
        print_warning "Container system status check failed"
    fi
    
    echo
    print_success "Container service restart completed!"
    if [ -t 0 ]; then
        read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
    fi
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Function: `stop_container_with_emergency_restart()`

Replaced `stop_container_with_force_restart()` with enhanced version that:

- Captures cleanup output and exit code
- Detects "delete failed for one or more containers" error
- Shows recommended emergency restart message
- Prompts user for automatic restart
- Executes restart sequence if approved
- Retries container stop after restart
- Performs final cleanup

### 3. Updated Main Menu

Added new option to main menu:
```
Main Menu:
1) Start Container (Full Sequence)
2) Stop Container (Full Sequence)
3) Show Container Status
4) Restart Service
5) Help
0) Exit
```

### 4. Enhanced Help Documentation

Updated `show_help()` function to include:
- Description of Restart Service option
- Emergency restart use cases
- Step-by-step restart sequence
- Integration with existing workflow

## Files Modified

### Core Script
- `scripts/native-container/native-container.sh`
  - Added `restart_container_service()` function
  - Enhanced `stop_container_with_emergency_restart()` function
  - Updated main menu and help
  - Added error detection and recovery logic

### Tests
- `tests/native-container/test_emergency_restart.py`
  - Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
  - 11 test cases covering all aspects
  - Syntax validation and error handling verification

### Documentation
- `docs/deployment/emergency-restart-service.md`
  - Complete user guide
  - Troubleshooting information
  - Usage examples and best practices

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
‚úÖ Passed: 11
‚ùå Failed: 0
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 0
üí• Errors: 0
üìà Total: 11
```

Bash syntax validation: ‚úÖ PASSED

## Key Features

### Automatic Error Detection
- Detects "delete failed for one or more containers" error
- Provides clear recommendation for emergency restart
- Maintains existing error handling for other issues

### Interactive Recovery
- Prompts user for emergency restart when needed
- Executes complete restart sequence automatically
- Retries failed operations after restart
- Provides clear status feedback

### Manual Restart Option
- New menu option 4 "Restart Service"
- Complete restart sequence: stop ‚Üí start ‚Üí status
- Useful for manual troubleshooting
- Integrated with existing workflow

### Non-Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatible with current usage
- Enhanced error handling without breaking existing logic
- Seamless integration with current workflow

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Recovery
1. Run `./scripts/native-container/native-container.sh`
2. Select option 2 "Stop Container"
3. If deletion fails, system shows emergency restart recommendation
4. Choose 'y' to automatically restart service and retry

### Manual Recovery
1. Run `./scripts/native-container/native-container.sh`
2. Select option 4 "Restart Service"
3. System executes: `container system stop` ‚Üí `container system start` ‚Üí `container system status`
4. Container service is restarted and ready for use

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Automatic recovery from common container issues
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages and recovery options
3. **Reduced Manual Intervention**: Automated restart and retry logic
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for new functionality
5. **Complete Documentation**: User guide and troubleshooting information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Automatic log analysis and reporting
- Enhanced error categorization
- Integration with system monitoring
- Automated health checks
- Performance optimization

## Conclusion

The emergency restart service functionality has been successfully implemented with:
- ‚úÖ Complete error detection and recovery
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Full documentation
- ‚úÖ Non-breaking integration
- ‚úÖ User-friendly interface

The system now provides robust handling of container deletion failures with automatic recovery options, significantly improving the reliability and user experience of the container management system.
