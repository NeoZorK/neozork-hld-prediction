# Native Container Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Problem
When running `./scripts/native-container/native-container.sh` and selecting "Start Container", errors occurred that caused the container to stop during initialization.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

### 1. Issue with read commands in non-interactive mode
**Problem**: Functions in `native-container.sh` contained `read -p` commands that caused errors in non-interactive mode.

**Solution**: Added `if [ -t 0 ]` checks before all `read` commands to support both interactive and non-interactive modes.

### 2. Issue with container termination in entrypoint
**Problem**: The container was stopping during execution of functions `verify_uv()`, `setup_uv_environment()`, and `show_usage_guide()` due to errors that caused exit.

**Solution**: Made all functions more resilient to errors:
- `verify_uv()`: UV test does not terminate container on errors
- `setup_uv_environment()`: Dependency installation does not terminate container on errors
- `show_usage_guide()`: Help does not terminate container when dependencies are missing

### 3. Issue with interactive mode in entrypoint
**Problem**: The container was trying to start an interactive bash shell in non-interactive mode.

**Solution**: Added `if [ -t 0 ]` check for conditional bash shell startup or `tail -f /dev/null` for background mode.

## ✅ Fixed Files

### 1. scripts/native-container/native-container.sh
- Added `if [ -t 0 ]` checks before all `read` commands
- Improved non-interactive mode handling
- Added graceful error handling

### 2. container-entrypoint.sh
- Fixed `verify_uv()` function - UV test does not terminate container
- Fixed `setup_uv_environment()` function - dependency installation does not terminate container
- Fixed `show_usage_guide()` function - help does not terminate container
- Fixed `main()` function - conditional bash shell startup

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests
1. **Setup**: `./scripts/native-container/setup.sh` - works correctly
2. **Run**: `./scripts/native-container/run.sh` - container starts
3. **Status**: `./scripts/native-container/run.sh --status` - shows correct status
4. **Exec**: `./scripts/native-container/exec.sh --shell` - successfully connects to container
5. **Stop**: `./scripts/native-container/stop.sh` - correctly stops container
6. **Cleanup**: `./scripts/native-container/cleanup.sh --all --force` - cleans up resources

### 🔧 Functionality
- ✅ Container starts and remains active
- ✅ UV package manager installs automatically
- ✅ Virtual environment is created
- ✅ Command wrappers are created
- ✅ Bash environment is configured
- ✅ Container is ready for use

## 📋 Commands for Testing

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Setup container
./scripts/native-container/setup.sh

# Start container
./scripts/native-container/run.sh

```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start interactive menu
./scripts/native-container/native-container.sh
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

All major issues have been fixed:
1. ✅ Container starts and remains active
2. ✅ Interactive script works correctly
3. ✅ Error handling improved
4. ✅ Support for both interactive and non-interactive modes
5. ✅ Automatic dependency installation works
6. ✅ All commands are available and functional
