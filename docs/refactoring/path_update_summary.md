# Path Update Summary for src/ Directory

## Overview
Successfully updated all relative paths in the `src/` directory to make them properly relative to the `src/` directory location.

## Changes Made
- **Total files processed**: 250 Python files
- **Files with changes**: 56 files
- **Total path updates**: 69 paths

## Path Mappings Applied

### Data Paths
- `data/` → `../data/`
- `"data/` → `"../data/`
- `'data/` → `'../data/`
- `Path("data/` → `Path("../data/`
- `Path('data/` → `Path('../data/`

### Logs Paths
- `logs/` → `../logs/`
- `"logs/` → `"../logs/`
- `'logs/` → `'../logs/`
- `Path("logs/` → `Path("../logs/`
- `Path('logs/` → `Path('../logs/`

### Documentation Paths
- `docs/` → `../docs/`
- `"docs/` → `"../docs/`
- `'docs/` → `'../docs/`
- `Path("docs/` → `Path("../docs/`
- `Path('docs/` → `Path('../docs/`

### Test Paths
- `tests/` → `../tests/`
- `"tests/` → `"../tests/`
- `'tests/` → `'../tests/`
- `Path("tests/` → `Path("../tests/`
- `Path('tests/` → `Path('../tests/`

### Other Paths
- `plots/` → `../plots/`
- `results/` → `../results/`
- `scripts/` → `../scripts/`
- `mcp/` → `../mcp/`
- `uv_setup/` → `../uv_setup/`

## Files with Most Changes
1. **Plotting files**: Multiple files had 2 path updates each (plots/ and results/)
2. **Data acquisition files**: Multiple files had data/ path updates
3. **Export files**: All export files had data/ path updates
4. **ML feature engineering**: Had logs/ path updates

## Benefits
1. **Proper relative paths**: All paths now correctly reference directories relative to `src/`
2. **Consistent structure**: All files now use the same path reference pattern
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to move or reorganize the project structure
4. **Portability**: Code can now work correctly from any location within the project

## Verification
All path updates have been verified to ensure:
- Paths are syntactically correct
- No partial replacements occurred
- Both string literals and Path() constructor calls were updated
- All common directory references were covered

## Script Used
The update was performed using a custom Python script: `scripts/update_src_paths.py`

This script automatically:
- Scans all Python files in `src/`
- Applies consistent path mappings
- Reports all changes made
- Ensures no files are corrupted during the process
