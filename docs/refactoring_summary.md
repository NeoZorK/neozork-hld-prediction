# Data Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `src/data/` module has been successfully refactored to improve maintainability and organization. All files now have less than 300 lines and are logically grouped into subdirectories.

## New Structure

### 1. Gap Fixing (`src/data/gap_fixing/`)
- **core.py** (257 lines) - Main GapFixer class and orchestration
- **algorithms.py** (169 lines) - Gap fixing strategy and algorithm selection
- **interpolation.py** (226 lines) - Various interpolation methods
- **explanation.py** (214 lines) - Documentation and explanation functions
- **utils.py** (235 lines) - Utility functions for gap fixing operations

### 2. Data Acquisition (`src/data/acquisition/`)
- **core.py** (102 lines) - Main acquisition orchestration
- **csv.py** (191 lines) - CSV data acquisition functionality
- **cache.py** (222 lines) - Data caching and management
- **ranges.py** (200 lines) - Date range calculations and validation
- **utils.py** (236 lines) - Acquisition utility functions
- **processing.py** (268 lines) - Data processing during acquisition

### 3. Data Processing (`src/data/processing/`)
- **csv_processor.py** (253 lines) - Individual CSV file processing
- **csv_folder_processor.py** (158 lines) - Folder-level CSV processing orchestration

### 4. Utilities (`src/data/utils/`)
- **__init__.py** (11 lines) - Placeholder for future utility modules

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each file now has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped logically
3. **Easier Testing**: Smaller modules are easier to test individually
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Code is more focused and easier to understand
5. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns between different aspects

## File Size Compliance
All new files comply with the 300-line limit requirement:
- Largest file: `acquisition/processing.py` (268 lines)
- Average file size: ~200 lines
- Total files: 18 (excluding fetchers/)

## Backward Compatibility
The main `__init__.py` file maintains all existing public interfaces, ensuring that existing code continues to work without modification.

## Migration Notes
- All original functionality has been preserved
- Import paths have been updated to use the new structure
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Existing tests should continue to pass
