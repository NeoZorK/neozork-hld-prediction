# Terminal Plotting Color Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Miss5. **Lines 273, 357**: Changed axes color from black to white for macOS terminal visibility
6. **Lines 273, 357**: Added ticks_color configuration for legend text visibility on dark backgroundsng Open Price Line ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The main OHLC chart in `term_plot.py` was only plotting Close, High, and Low prices. The Open price line was completely missing.

**Solution**: Added Open price line with distinct color:
```python
plt.plot(x_data, df['Open'].tolist(), label="Open", color="bright_magenta")
```

### 2. Open and Close Same Color ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Both Open and Close prices were using the hardcoded `"cyan+"` color, making them indistinguishable.

**Solution**: Implemented distinct color scheme consistent with `term_auto_plot.py`:
- Open: `"bright_magenta"` (pink/purple)
- High: `"bright_cyan"` (light blue)  
- Low: `"bright_red"` (red)
- Close: `"bright_blue"` (blue)

### 3. PPrice1/PPrice2 Color Differentiation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: PPrice1 and PPrice2 (predicted prices) were using similar colors that made them hard to distinguish.

**Solution**: Updated predicted prices color scheme:
- PPrice1: `"bright_green"` (green)
- PPrice2: `"bright_red"` (red)  
- Other predicted prices: `"bright_yellow"`, `"bright_magenta"`, `"bright_white"`

### 4. Fallback Scenarios ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Fallback plotting scenarios also used hardcoded `"cyan+"` colors.

**Solution**: Updated fallback colors to use `"bright_blue"` for consistency.

### 5. macOS Terminal Visibility ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `axes_color('black')` setting made axis labels, legends, and plot annotations invisible on dark terminal backgrounds (common on macOS and Docker).

**Solution**: Changed `axes_color('black')` to `axes_color('white')` in both main plotting function and fallback plotting function.

### 6. Legend Text Color Visibility ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Legend text was invisible on dark terminal backgrounds in macOS terminals when using `-d term` flag. The legend text color defaulted to black, making it invisible against dark terminal backgrounds.

**Solution**: Added `plt.ticks_color('white')` configuration in both main plotting and fallback sections to ensure legend text, axes labels, and numerical ticks are visible on dark backgrounds.

**Files Modified**: `term_plot.py` (lines 273 and 357)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Main plotting section (line 273):
plt.ticks_color('white')  # Controls legend text, axes labels, and numerical ticks

# Fallback plotting section (line 357):
plt.ticks_color('white')  # Ensure legend text is visible on dark terminal backgrounds
```

This ensures that legend text, axes labels, and numerical ticks are visible on dark terminal backgrounds across all plotting scenarios.

## Files Modified

### `/workspaces/neozork-hld-prediction/src/plotting/term_plot.py`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Lines 277-281**: Added missing Open price line and updated OHLC color scheme
2. **Lines 49-52**: Updated custom indicators color mapping for PPrice1/PPrice2  
3. **Lines 286**: Updated fallback price column color
4. **Lines 357**: Updated ultra-simple fallback color
5. **Lines 167-171**: Updated predicted prices color scheme
6. **Lines 273, 356**: Changed axes color from black to white for macOS terminal visibility

## Color Mapping Summary

### OHLC Colors (Main Chart)
```python
Open:  "bright_magenta"  # Pink/Purple - was missing before
High:  "bright_cyan"     # Light Blue  
Low:   "bright_red"      # Red
Close: "bright_blue"     # Blue - was cyan+ before
```

### Predicted Prices Colors  
```python
PPrice1: "bright_green"    # Green - was lime+ before
PPrice2: "bright_red"      # Red - was red+ before  
Other:   "bright_yellow", "bright_magenta", "bright_white"
```

### Custom Indicators Colors
```python
HL:       "bright_yellow"   
Pressure: "bright_magenta"
PPrice1:  "bright_green"   # Better distinction
PPrice2:  "bright_red"     # Better distinction
```

## Testing

Created verification script `/workspaces/neozork-hld-prediction/verify_color_fix.py` that:
- ✅ Confirms Open price line is now visible
- ✅ Verifies all OHLC components have distinct colors
- ✅ Tests PPrice1/PPrice2 color differentiation  
- ✅ Validates Docker routing to terminal mode
- ✅ Ensures consistency with `term_auto_plot.py` color scheme
- ✅ Confirms axis/legend text visibility on dark terminals

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Open price line was missing entirely
- ❌ Open and Close both appeared as bright cyan (indistinguishable)
- ❌ PPrice1 and PPrice2 had poor color differentiation
- ❌ Axis and legend text invisible on dark terminal backgrounds
- ❌ Legend text color invisible on macOS dark terminals
- ❌ Poor overall visual clarity in terminal plots

### After Fix:
- ✅ All four OHLC components are now visible
- ✅ Each OHLC component has a distinct bright color
- ✅ PPrice1 (green) and PPrice2 (red) are easily distinguishable
- ✅ Consistent color scheme across terminal plotting modules
- ✅ Axes and legend text visible on dark terminal backgrounds  
- ✅ Legend text clearly visible on macOS dark terminals
- ✅ Better visual clarity and user experience in Docker/terminal environments

## Compatibility

- ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility
- ✅ Works in Docker environments (auto-routes to terminal mode)
- ✅ Consistent with existing `term_auto_plot.py` implementation
- ✅ No breaking changes to other plotting modes (plotly, fast, etc.)
