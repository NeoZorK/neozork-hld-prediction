# Chart Height Final Adjustment Summary

Final adjustment of chart height in terminal plotting mode (`-d term`) for command `uv run run_analysis.py show csv gbp -d term --rule macd:12,26,9,close`.

## Issue Resolved

### ✅ Problem: Long Chart Title Not Visible in Fullscreen
**Problem**: The long chart title "MACD:12,26,9,CLOSE Terminal Plot: CSVExport_GBPUSD_PERIOD_MN1.parquet (CALCULATED NOW) - OHLC Chart (Chunk 1/8) - 1993-06-01 00:00:00 to 1997-07-01 00:00:00" was not fully visible in fullscreen mode.

**Solution**: Further reduced chart height from 35 to 30 lines to provide additional space for the long chart title.

## Technical Changes

### Chart Height Optimization

**Before**: `plt.plot_size(200, 35)` - 35 lines height
**After**: `plt.plot_size(200, 30)` - 30 lines height (14.3% reduction)

### Total Height Reduction History
- **Original**: 50 lines
- **First adjustment**: 45 lines (10% reduction)
- **Second adjustment**: 40 lines (20% reduction)
- **Third adjustment**: 39 lines (22% reduction)
- **Fourth adjustment**: 35 lines (30% reduction)
- **Final adjustment**: 30 lines (40% total reduction)
