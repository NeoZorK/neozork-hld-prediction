# Chunked Processing Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: The comprehensive data quality check was failing with a `TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'` error when processing large datasets using chunked processing.

**Error Details**:
```
‚ùå Error in comprehensive data quality check: string indices must be integers, not 'str'

TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem occurred because of a mismatch between what the `_process_large_dataframe_in_chunks` function returns and what the individual data quality check functions expected:

1. **Function Return Type Mismatch**: The `_process_large_dataframe_in_chunks` function was designed to return a combined dictionary when processing dictionaries, but the data quality functions expected a list of dictionaries.

2. **Inconsistent Data Handling**: Different data quality functions (`nan_check`, `duplicate_check`, `zero_check`, `negative_check`, `inf_check`) were all affected by this issue.

3. **Type Checking Missing**: The functions didn't check the type of returned results before processing them.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed All Data Quality Functions

**File**: `src/eda/data_quality.py`

Updated all functions that use `_process_large_dataframe_in_chunks` to properly handle the returned data types:

#### 1. `duplicate_check()`
```python
# Before (causing error)
if chunk_results:
    total_dupes = sum(result['duplicates'] for result in chunk_results)

# After (fixed)
if chunk_results and isinstance(chunk_results, dict):
    total_dupes = chunk_results.get('duplicates', 0)
```

#### 2. `nan_check()`
```python
# Before (causing error)
if chunk_results:
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:
        for item in chunk_result:

# After (fixed)
if chunk_results and isinstance(chunk_results, list):
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:
        for item in chunk_result:
```

#### 3. `zero_check()`
```python
# Before (causing error)
if chunk_results:
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:

# After (fixed)
if chunk_results and isinstance(chunk_results, list):
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:
```

#### 4. `negative_check()`
```python
# Before (causing error)
if chunk_results:
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:

# After (fixed)
if chunk_results and isinstance(chunk_results, list):
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:
```

#### 5. `inf_check()`
```python
# Before (causing error)
if chunk_results:
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:

# After (fixed)
if chunk_results and isinstance(chunk_results, list):
    for chunk_result in chunk_results:
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Type Checking**: Added `isinstance()` checks to verify the type of returned results
2. **Proper Data Access**: Updated how results are accessed based on their actual type
3. **Consistent Handling**: Made all functions handle chunked results consistently
4. **Error Prevention**: Added safeguards to prevent similar errors in the future
