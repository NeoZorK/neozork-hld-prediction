# Navigation Help String Improvement

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

**Successfully improved navigation help strings to be more understandable and user-friendly.**

## Problem Addressed

### Original Issue
The navigation help string was not very clear and user-friendly:
```
[AUTO Navigation: type 'n/p/s/e/c/d/f/b/g/h/q' -> chunk/field/group navigation]
```

### User Feedback
The help string was too technical and not intuitive for users to understand quickly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved AUTO Navigation Help String

**Before**:
```
[AUTO Navigation: type 'n/p/s/e/c/d/f/b/g/h/q' -> chunk/field/group navigation]
```

**After**:
```
[AUTO Navigation: n/p/s/e/c/d for chunks, f/b/g/h for fields, ? for help, q to quit]
```

### 2. Improved Standard Navigation Help String

**Before**:
```
[Navigation: type 'n/p/s/e/c/d/q' -> next/previous/start/end/choose chunk/choose date/quit]
```

**After**:
```
[Navigation: n/p/s/e/c/d for chunks, ? for help, q to quit]
```

### 3. Enhanced Help Display

**Updated help function to be more organized and clear**:

```
============================================================
AUTO TERMINAL NAVIGATION HELP
============================================================
Chunk Navigation:
  n - Next chunk
  p - Previous chunk
  s - Start (first chunk)
  e - End (last chunk)
  c - Choose chunk by number
  d - Choose chunk by date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Field Navigation:
  f - Next field
  b - Previous field
  g - Next field group
  h - Previous field group

System Commands:
  ? - Show this help
  q - Quit navigation
  Enter - Continue to next chunk (original behavior)
============================================================
```
