# Restore from Backup Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: When running "Comprehensive Data Quality Check" and then choosing "Restore from Backup", the system showed "No backup files found" even though backup files were created.

**User Experience**: 
```
✅ Comprehensive data quality check completed!
• Backup saved to: data/backups/data_backup_1756373602.parquet
• Fixed data saved to: data/backups/data_fixed_1756373605.parquet

🔄 RESTORE FROM BACKUP
==================================================
❌ No backup files found in data/backups/
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem occurred because:

1. **Different File Naming**: Comprehensive Data Quality Check creates files with names like:
   - `data_backup_*.parquet` (original data backup)
   - `data_fixed_*.parquet` (fixed data backup)

2. **Limited Search Pattern**: The restore function was only looking for files with pattern `backup_*.parquet`

3. **Missing File Types**: The function didn't search for the actual backup file types created by the comprehensive check

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Backup File Detection

**File**: `src/interactive/data_manager.py`

Updated the `restore_from_backup()` method to search for all types of backup files:

```python
# Look for all types of backup files
backup_files = list(backup_dir.glob("backup_*.parquet"))
data_backup_files = list(backup_dir.glob("data_backup_*.parquet"))
data_fixed_files = list(backup_dir.glob("data_fixed_*.parquet"))

# Combine all backup files
all_backup_files = backup_files + data_backup_files + data_fixed_files
```

### Key Features of the Fix

1. **Comprehensive Search**: Searches for all backup file patterns:
   - `backup_*.parquet` (legacy backup files)
   - `data_backup_*.parquet` (comprehensive check original backups)
   - `data_fixed_*.parquet` (comprehensive check fixed data backups)

2. **Enhanced Display**: Shows file size and creation time for better user experience:
   ```python
   file_time = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.localtime(backup_file.stat().st_mtime))
   print(f"   {i}. {backup_file.name} ({file_size:.1f} MB, {file_time})")
   ```

3. **Menu Tracking**: Properly marks the restore operation as completed in the menu system

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing backup file formats

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests Added

**File**: `tests/interactive/test_restore_backup.py`

Added comprehensive test suite with 6 test cases:

1. **`test_restore_from_backup_no_data`**: Tests error handling when no data is loaded
2. **`test_restore_from_backup_no_backup_files`**: Tests when no backup files exist
3. **`test_restore_from_backup_with_data_backup_files`**: Tests with `data_backup_*.parquet` files
4. **`test_restore_from_backup_with_regular_backup_files`**: Tests with `backup_*.parquet` files
5. **`test_restore_from_backup_invalid_choice`**: Tests invalid user input handling
6. **`test_restore_from_backup_test_mode`**: Tests automatic restoration in test environment

### Test Results

```
✅ Passed: 6
❌ Failed: 0
⏭️  Skipped: 0
💥 Errors: 0
📈 Total: 6

## User Experience Improvement

### Before (Backup Files Not Found)

```
🔄 RESTORE FROM BACKUP
==================================================
❌ No backup files found in data/backups/
```

### After (Backup Files Found and Listed)

```
🔄 RESTORE FROM BACKUP
==================================================
📁 Found 2 backup files:
   1. data_backup_1756373602.parquet (45.2 MB, 2025-01-28 12:30:02)
   2. data_fixed_1756373605.parquet (44.8 MB, 2025-01-28 12:30:05)
