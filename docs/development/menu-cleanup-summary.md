# Menu Cleanup Summary - Basic Data Quality Check Removal

## Changes Made

Successfully removed the "2. 🔍 Basic Data Quality Check" option from the EDA Analysis menu in the interactive system.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/interactive/menu_manager.py`
- **Removed**: "2. 🔍 Basic Data Quality Check" from the EDA menu display
- **Renumbered**: All subsequent menu items (3→2, 4→3, 5→4, 6→5, 7→6, 8→7)
- **Updated**: Menu range from "0-8" to "0-7"
- **Removed**: `'data_quality_check': False` from the `used_menus['eda']` dictionary

### 2. `src/interactive/analysis_runner.py`
- **Removed**: `run_data_quality_check()` method (entire function)
- **Updated**: `run_eda_analysis()` method to handle new menu numbering
- **Updated**: Menu choice handling (choice '2' now calls `run_basic_statistics` instead of `run_data_quality_check`)
- **Updated**: Error message from "Please select 0-8" to "Please select 0-7"

### 3. `src/interactive/core.py`
- **Removed**: `run_data_quality_check()` method for backward compatibility

### 4. `tests/interactive/test_comprehensive_data_quality_check.py`
- **Updated**: `test_backward_compatibility()` to remove references to the deleted `run_data_quality_check` method
- **Simplified**: Test now only checks for `run_comprehensive_data_quality_check` functionality

## Menu Structure Before and After

### Before
```
🔍 EDA ANALYSIS MENU:
0. 🔙 Back to Main Menu
1. 🧹 Comprehensive Data Quality Check
2. 🔍 Basic Data Quality Check

### After
```
🔍 EDA ANALYSIS MENU:
0. 🔙 Back to Main Menu
1. 🧹 Comprehensive Data Quality Check
2. 📊 Basic Statistics
3. 🔗 Correlation Analysis
4. 📈 Time Series Analysis
5. 🎯 Feature Importance

## Rationale

The "Basic Data Quality Check" was removed because:

1. **Redundancy**: The "Comprehensive Data Quality Check" provides all the functionality of the basic check plus much more
2. **User Confusion**: Having two similar options could confuse users about which one to use
3. **Maintenance**: Removing duplicate functionality reduces code maintenance burden
4. **Streamlined Experience**: A cleaner menu with fewer options provides better user experience

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
✅ Passed: 17
❌ Failed: 0
⏭️  Skipped: 0
💥 Errors: 0
📈 Total: 17
```

## Impact

- **Positive**: Cleaner, more focused menu structure
- **Positive**: Reduced code complexity and maintenance
- **Positive**: Better user experience with clear choice (Comprehensive vs Basic)
- **Neutral**: No functional impact on existing features
- **Neutral**: All comprehensive data quality check functionality remains intact

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing comprehensive data quality check functionality preserved
- ✅ All other EDA menu items continue to work as expected
- ✅ Menu tracking and completion percentages updated correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to the core system functionality

The removal of the basic data quality check option streamlines the menu while preserving all essential functionality through the comprehensive data quality check feature.
