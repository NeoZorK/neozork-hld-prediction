**Root Cause**: Missing colorama import causing `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'MAGENTA'`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Colorama Import with Fallback

**File**: `src/interactive/analysis_runner.py`

```python
# Import colorama for data quality checks
try:
    from colorama import Fore, Style
except ImportError:
    # Fallback classes if colorama is not available
    class Fore:
        MAGENTA = ""
        YELLOW = ""
        RED = ""
        GREEN = ""
        CYAN = ""
        BLUE = ""
        RESET = ""
    
    class Style:
        BRIGHT = ""
        RESET = ""
        RESET_ALL = ""
```

### 2. Updated Function Calls

Replaced all `SimpleFore()` and `SimpleStyle()` with imported `Fore` and `Style`:

```python
# Before
data_quality.nan_check(system.current_data, nan_summary, SimpleFore(), SimpleStyle())

# After
data_quality.nan_check(system.current_data, nan_summary, Fore, Style)
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all fix operations with detailed error reporting.

## Testing Results

### Docker Integration Test

**Command**:
```bash
docker-compose exec neozork-hld bash -c 'echo -e "1\n1\nsample_ohlcv_with_issues.csv\ny\n2\n1\ny" | python /app/interactive_system.py'
```

**Results**:

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Robust Import Handling**
- Graceful fallback if colorama is not available
- No crashes due to missing dependencies
- Consistent behavior across environments

### 2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around all fix operations
- Detailed error messages and stack traces
- Graceful degradation when errors occur

### 3. **Data Safety**
- Original data preserved in backups
- Fixed data saved separately
- Verification process ensures data integrity

### 4. **User Experience**
- Clear progress indicators
- Detailed feedback on each operation
- No unexpected exits to shell

## Files Modified

- `src/interactive/analysis_runner.py` - Added colorama import and enhanced error handling
- `tests/interactive/test_data_fixing_error_handling.py` - Added comprehensive error handling tests

2. **Better User Experience**: Clear feedback and progress indicators
3. **Data Safety**: Automatic backups and verification
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when issues occur
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with or without colorama

## Verification

The fix has been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: All error handling tests pass ‚úÖ
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing in Docker container ‚úÖ
3. **Real Data Testing**: Successfully fixed actual data issues ‚úÖ
4. **Error Scenarios**: Tested with various error conditions ‚úÖ

## Conclusion

The Docker shell exit issue has been completely resolved. The system now:

- ‚úÖ Successfully completes data fixing operations
- ‚úÖ Provides detailed progress feedback
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully without crashes
- ‚úÖ Preserves data integrity with automatic backups
- ‚úÖ Works consistently across different environments

The fix ensures that users can confidently use the data fixing functionality without fear of losing their work or experiencing unexpected system exits.
