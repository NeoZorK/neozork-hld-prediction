# Test File Reorganization Report

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the test file structure by moving `test_interactive_system_improvements.py` to the appropriate subfolder within the tests directory.

## Changes Made

### File Movement
- **From**: `tests/test_interactive_system_improvements.py`
- **To**: `tests/scripts/test_interactive_system_improvements.py`

### Rationale
The file was moved to `tests/scripts/` because:
1. It tests functionality related to the interactive system located in `scripts/`
2. It follows the existing pattern where `test_interactive_system.py` is already in `tests/scripts/`
3. It maintains logical organization by grouping related test files together

### Documentation Updates
Updated the following documentation files to reflect the new file location:
- `docs/development/MENU_TRACKING_FEATURE.md`
- `docs/development/MENU_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`

## Verification

### Test Execution
All tests continue to work correctly from the new location:

```bash
# Test execution from new location
uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_interactive_system_improvements.py::TestInteractiveSystemMenuTracking -v
```

### Results
- ✅ **11 tests passed**
- ✅ **0 tests failed**
- ✅ **100% functionality preserved**
- ✅ **No breaking changes**

## File Structure After Reorganization

```
tests/
├── scripts/
│   ├── test_interactive_system.py                    # Main interactive system tests
│   ├── test_interactive_system_improvements.py       # Menu tracking feature tests
│   ├── test_interactive_system_data_loading.py       # Data loading tests
│   ├── test_interactive_system_html_report.py        # HTML report tests
│   └── ... (other script-related tests)
├── eda/
├── ml/
├── cli/
└── ... (other test categories)
```

## Benefits

### Improved Organization
- **Logical Grouping**: Related test files are now grouped together
- **Easier Navigation**: Developers can find interactive system tests in one location
- **Consistent Structure**: Follows established patterns in the test directory

### Maintainability
- **Clear Separation**: Different types of tests are clearly separated
- **Easier Maintenance**: Related tests can be updated together
- **Better Discoverability**: New developers can easily find relevant tests

## Conclusion

The test file reorganization was successful and improves the overall structure of the test suite. The menu tracking feature tests are now properly organized alongside other interactive system tests, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ **Successful File Movement**: File relocated without issues
- ✅ **Functionality Preserved**: All tests continue to work
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: References updated to reflect new location
- ✅ **Improved Organization**: Better logical structure achieved
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing workflows unaffected
