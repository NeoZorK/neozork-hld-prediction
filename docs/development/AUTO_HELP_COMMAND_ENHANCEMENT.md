# AUTO Help Command Enhancement Summary

Successfully added "help" command support for AUTO mode navigation in addition to the existing "?" command.

## Issue Resolved

### ✅ Problem: Only "?" Command Available for Help
**Problem**: The AUTO navigation mode only supported the "?" command to show help, but users might expect to type "help" as well.

**Solution**: Added "help" command as an alias for the "?" command in AutoTerminalNavigator, providing users with multiple ways to access help.

## Technical Changes

### Updated AutoTerminalNavigator Class

**File**: `src/plotting/term_navigation.py`

#### 1. Added "help" Command to Commands Dictionary
```python
# Extended commands for field navigation
self.commands.update({
    'f': self._next_field,
    'b': self._previous_field,
    'g': self._next_group,
    'h': self._previous_group,
    '?': self._show_help,
    'help': self._show_help,  # NEW: Added help command
})
```

#### 2. Updated Navigation Prompt
```python
# Before
print(f"\n[AUTO Navigation: n/p/s/e/c/d for chunks, f/b/g/h for fields, ? for help, q to quit]")

# After  
print(f"\n[AUTO Navigation: n/p/s/e/c/d for chunks, f/b/g/h for fields, ?/help for help, q to quit]")
```

### Enhanced User Experience

#### Available Help Commands
- `?` - Show help (existing)
- `help` - Show help (new)

Both commands display the same comprehensive help information:

```
============================================================
AUTO TERMINAL NAVIGATION HELP
============================================================
Chunk Navigation:
  n - Next chunk
  p - Previous chunk
  s - Start (first chunk)
  e - End (last chunk)
  c - Choose chunk by number
  d - Choose chunk by date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Field Navigation:
  f - Next field
  b - Previous field
  g - Next field group
  h - Previous field group

System Commands:
  ? - Show this help
  q - Quit navigation
  Enter - Continue to next chunk (original behavior)
============================================================
```

## Testing

### Added Comprehensive Tests

**File**: `tests/plotting/test_auto_navigation.py`

#### New Test Cases:
1. `test_help_command()` - Verifies help command shows correct information
2. `test_help_command_in_commands()` - Ensures "help" is registered in commands
3. `test_help_vs_question_mark()` - Confirms both commands point to same method

### Test Results
```
✅ All 15 tests passed
✅ Help command functionality verified
✅ Both "?" and "help" commands work identically
```

## Usage Example

### Command
```bash
uv run run_analysis.py show csv gbp -d term --rule AUTO
```

### Navigation Prompt
```
[AUTO Navigation: n/p/s/e/c/d for chunks, f/b/g/h for fields, ?/help for help, q to quit]
Chunk: 1/8 (1993-06-01 00:00:00 to 1997-07-01 00:00:00)
Field: Pressure - Pressure Indicators
Current: pressure (1/2)
Press Enter to continue or type navigation command: help
```

### Help Output
```
============================================================
AUTO TERMINAL NAVIGATION HELP
============================================================
Chunk Navigation:

  p - Previous chunk
  s - Start (first chunk)
  e - End (last chunk)

## Benefits
