# Docker EOF Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Interactive system in Docker was exiting to shell when selecting "y" to fix all data issues.

## Root Cause
Missing EOF (End of File) error handling in interactive loops causing unexpected exits in Docker environment.

## Solution
Added comprehensive EOF handling in:
- `src/interactive/analysis_runner.py` - EDA menu loop
- `src/interactive/core.py` - Main loop and safe_input function

## Files Modified
- `src/interactive/analysis_runner.py` - Added EOF handling in EDA menu
- `src/interactive/core.py` - Added EOF handling in main loop and safe_input
- `tests/interactive/test_docker_eof_fix.py` - Added comprehensive test suite
- `scripts/docker/test_docker_eof_fix.sh` - Added Docker test script
- `docs/development/docker-eof-fix-summary.md` - Added detailed documentation

## Testing
- ✅ 5 unit tests created and passing
- ✅ Docker test script created
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved

## Result
Interactive system now handles EOF gracefully in Docker and doesn't exit unexpectedly after fixing data issues.
