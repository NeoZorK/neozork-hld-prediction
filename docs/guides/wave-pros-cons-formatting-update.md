# Wave Indicator Pros and Cons - Formatting Update

## Overview

Updated the display formatting for Wave indicator pros and cons to improve readability by displaying each point on a separate line instead of a single comma-separated line.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated IndicatorSearcher Display Logic

**File**: `src/cli/indicators_search.py`

- Modified the `display` method in `IndicatorInfo` class
- Changed pros and cons display from single line to multi-line format
- Added proper indentation for each point (2 spaces)
- Improved visual separation between pros and cons sections

### 2. Updated Docstring Format

**File**: `src/calculation/indicators/trend/wave_ind.py`

- Reformatted pros and cons in docstring to use line breaks
- Each point now starts on a new line for better maintainability
- Maintained comma-separated format for parsing compatibility

### 3. Updated Documentation

**File**: `docs/guides/wave-indicator-pros-cons.md`

- Updated example output to reflect new formatting
- Improved readability of documentation examples

## Before vs After

### Before (Single Line Format)
```
üëç Pros: ‚úÖ Dual Signal Validation: Two-wave system for improved reliability, ‚úÖ Flexible Configuration: Multiple trading rules and filters, ‚úÖ Strong Trend Identification: Excellent for trending markets, ‚úÖ Zone-Based Filtering: Helps avoid counter-trend trades, ‚úÖ Momentum Validation: Advanced signal filtering algorithms, ‚úÖ Visual Clarity: Clear color coding and multiple visual elements, ‚úÖ Comprehensive Signal Types: Various signal combinations, ‚úÖ Professional Grade: Sophisticated algorithms for advanced strategies
üëé Cons: ‚ùå Complex Setup: Requires extensive parameter testing, ‚ùå Lag in Ranging Markets: May be slow in sideways markets, ‚ùå Parameter Sensitivity: Performance depends heavily on proper settings, ‚ùå Resource Intensive: Multiple calculations may impact performance, ‚ùå Learning Curve: Complex rules require significant study time, ‚ùå Over-Optimization Risk: Multiple parameters increase curve-fitting risk, ‚ùå Signal Frequency: May generate fewer signals than simpler indicators, ‚ùå Market Dependency: Best in trending markets, weaker in ranging conditions
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes in IndicatorSearcher

```python
# Before
output.append(f"{Fore.GREEN}üëç Pros:{Style.RESET_ALL} {', '.join(pros_formatted)}")
output.append(f"{Fore.RED}üëé Cons:{Style.RESET_ALL} {', '.join(cons_formatted)}")

# After
output.append(f"{Fore.GREEN}üëç Pros:{Style.RESET_ALL}")
for pro in pros_formatted:
    output.append(f"  {pro}")

output.append(f"{Fore.RED}üëé Cons:{Style.RESET_ALL}")
for con in cons_formatted:
    output.append(f"  {con}")
```

### Docstring Format

```python
"""
INDICATOR INFO:
Name: WAVE
Description: [Description]
Usage: [Usage]
Parameters: [Parameters]
Pros: Dual Signal Validation: Two-wave system for improved reliability, 
Flexible Configuration: Multiple trading rules and filters, 
Strong Trend Identification: Excellent for trending markets, 
Zone-Based Filtering: Helps avoid counter-trend trades, 
Momentum Validation: Advanced signal filtering algorithms, 
Visual Clarity: Clear color coding and multiple visual elements, 
Comprehensive Signal Types: Various signal combinations, 
Professional Grade: Sophisticated algorithms for advanced strategies
Cons: Complex Setup: Requires extensive parameter testing, 
Lag in Ranging Markets: May be slow in sideways markets, 
Parameter Sensitivity: Performance depends heavily on proper settings, 
Resource Intensive: Multiple calculations may impact performance, 
Learning Curve: Complex rules require significant study time, 
Over-Optimization Risk: Multiple parameters increase curve-fitting risk, 
Signal Frequency: May generate fewer signals than simpler indicators, 
Market Dependency: Best in trending markets, weaker in ranging conditions
"""
```

## Benefits

### Improved Readability

1. **Clear Separation**: Each point is clearly separated on its own line
2. **Better Scanning**: Easier to quickly scan through pros and cons
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less overwhelming than a single long line
4. **Professional Appearance**: More polished and professional-looking output

### Enhanced User Experience

1. **Easier Comparison**: Users can easily compare different points
2. **Better Accessibility**: More accessible for users with visual impairments
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Better display on smaller screens and mobile devices
4. **Print Friendly**: Better formatting for printed documentation

### Developer Benefits

1. **Maintainable Code**: Easier to add, remove, or modify individual points
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized approach across all indicators
3. **Extensible Design**: Framework can be applied to other indicators
4. **Better Testing**: Easier to test individual points and formatting

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass with the new formatting:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/cli/test_wave_pros_cons.py -v
```

**Results**: ‚úÖ All 8 tests passed successfully

## Usage

The formatting update is automatically applied when using the existing commands:

```bash
# Basic search
uv run run_analysis.py --indicators wave

# Category-specific search
uv run run_analysis.py --indicators trend wave

# Alternative commands
./nz --indicators wave
docker-compose run --rm app nz --indicators wave
```

## Future Enhancements

The new formatting system provides a foundation for future improvements:

1. **Numbered Lists**: Add numbering to pros and cons for easier reference
2. **Categories**: Group related pros and cons into subcategories
3. **Interactive Selection**: Allow users to expand/collapse sections
4. **Export Options**: Better formatting for export to different formats
5. **Customization**: Allow users to customize display preferences

## Conclusion

The formatting update significantly improves the readability and user experience of the Wave indicator pros and cons display. The multi-line format makes it easier for traders to quickly understand the strengths and limitations of the indicator, leading to better-informed trading decisions.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing a much more user-friendly interface for accessing indicator information.
