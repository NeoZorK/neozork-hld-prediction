## üìä Available Metrics

### Core Performance Metrics
- **Win Ratio:** Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor:** Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Average win size divided by average loss size

### Risk-Adjusted Returns
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Sortino Ratio:** Downside deviation-based measure
- **Calmar Ratio:** Annual return divided by maximum drawdown

### Risk Management
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Volatility:** Standard deviation of returns
- **Risk of Ruin:** Probability of losing entire capital

### Position Sizing
- **Kelly Fraction:** Optimal fraction of capital to risk per trade

### Performance
- **Total Return:** Overall percentage return
- **Net Return:** Return after trading costs
- **Strategy Efficiency:** Net return as percentage of gross return

### Strategy Analysis
- **Break-Even Win Rate:** Minimum win rate for profitability
- **Signal Frequency:** Number of trading signals per time period
- **Signal Accuracy:** Percentage of profitable signals

### Probability Analysis
- **Probability Risk Ratio:** Ratio of winning to losing probability

## üí° Strategy Tips

### Win Rate Optimization
- Higher win rate is NOT always better
- Optimal range: 40-70% for most strategies
- Focus on risk-adjusted returns

### Risk Management Excellence
- Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Use Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing
- Maximum drawdown should never exceed 20%

### Monte Carlo Analysis
- Run 10,000+ simulations to assess strategy robustness
- Focus on 95% confidence intervals
- Test across different market conditions

### Neural Network Strategies
- Use ensemble methods for better predictions
- Feature engineering is more important than model complexity
- Regular retraining prevents model decay

### Deep Learning for Trading
- LSTM networks excel at capturing temporal dependencies
- Attention mechanisms improve prediction accuracy
- Regularization prevents overfitting

### Strategy Development
- Start simple: complex strategies often underperform
- Focus on edge identification, not prediction accuracy
- Market regime detection improves performance

### Profit Factor Optimization
- Aim for profit factor > 1.5 for sustainable profitability
- Profit factor is more important than win rate
- Improve through better exit strategies

### Position Sizing Mastery
- Kelly Criterion provides optimal position sizing
- Position size should scale with account size
- Reduce position size during drawdowns

### Backtesting Best Practices
- Use out-of-sample testing to prevent overfitting
- Include realistic transaction costs and slippage
- Test across multiple market conditions
