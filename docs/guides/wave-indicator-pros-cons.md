## Implementation Details

### File Structure

The pros and cons analysis is implemented in the Wave indicator file:

```
src/calculation/indicators/trend/wave_ind.py
```

### Docstring Format

The analysis is stored in the indicator's docstring using a specific format:

```python
"""
INDICATOR INFO:
Name: WAVE
Description: [Description]
Usage: [Usage]
Parameters: [Parameters]
Pros: [Comma-separated list of pros]
Cons: [Comma-separated list of cons]
"""
```

### CLI Integration

The analysis is displayed through the `IndicatorSearcher` class in:

```
src/cli/indicators_search.py
```

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are available to ensure the functionality works correctly:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/cli/test_wave_pros_cons.py -v
```

### Test Coverage

The tests cover:

- Pros and cons extraction from docstring
- Proper formatting and display
- CLI command functionality
- Integration with indicator search system
- Data structure validation

## Best Practices

### For Traders

1. **Read the Analysis**: Always review both pros and cons before using the indicator
2. **Consider Market Conditions**: The indicator works best in trending markets
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Take time to test different parameter combinations
4. **Risk Management**: Use proper position sizing and stop-losses
5. **Education**: Study the indicator's rules and logic before live trading

### For Developers

1. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep pros and cons updated with any changes
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass before deploying changes
