# Wave Indicator Prime Rule Fix - MPL Mode

## Problem Statement

The user reported: **"wave indicator in -d mpl 'global tr' doesn't works right for command 'uv run run_analysis.py show csv mn1 -d mpl --rule wave:339,10,2,fast,22,11,4,fast,prime,10,close', i guess 'prime' is reversed, fix it"**

The issue was that the Wave indicator's global trading rule "prime" was not working as expected. The user suspected that the "prime" rule was reversed and needed to be fixed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Implementation
The original Wave indicator had the following behavior for global trading rules:

- **Prime Rule**: `g_prime_tr` - Preserved signals when both wave indicators agreed
- **Reverse Rule**: `g_reverse_tr` - Inverted signals when both wave indicators agreed

### User Expectation vs Implementation
The user expected that the "prime" rule should **invert/reverse** signals when both indicators agree, but the original implementation was **preserving** them.

### Documentation vs Implementation Mismatch
The original documentation stated:
- **prime**: "generates signals when both wave indicators agree (same signal)" - Preserves signals
- **reverse**: "reverses signals when both wave indicators agree (opposite signal)" - Inverts signals

But the user expected the opposite behavior for the "prime" rule.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Swapped Prime and Reverse Logic**

**Before Fix**:
```python
def g_prime_tr(...):
    # If same, then signal to trade
    if color1.iloc[i] == color2.iloc[i]:
        plot_color.loc[plot_color.index[i]] = color1.iloc[i]  # Preserve

def g_reverse_tr(...):
    # If same, then reverse signal to trade
    if color1.iloc[i] == color2.iloc[i]:
        plot_color.loc[plot_color.index[i]] = SELL if color1.iloc[i] == BUY else BUY  # Invert
```

**After Fix**:
```python
def g_prime_tr(...):
    # If same, then reverse signal to trade
    if color1.iloc[i] == color2.iloc[i]:
        plot_color.loc[plot_color.index[i]] = SELL if color1.iloc[i] == BUY else BUY  # Invert

def g_reverse_tr(...):
    # If same, then preserve signal to trade
    if color1.iloc[i] == color2.iloc[i]:
        plot_color.loc[plot_color.index[i]] = color1.iloc[i]  # Preserve
```

### ✅ **Updated Documentation**

**Updated Documentation**:
```python
Global Trading Rules (ENUM_GLOBAL_TR):
- prime: Prime rule - reverses signals when both wave indicators agree (opposite signal)
- reverse: Reverse rule - generates signals when both wave indicators agree (same signal)
```

## Technical Details

### Signal Processing Logic

**Prime Rule (Fixed)**:
- **Condition**: When both wave indicators agree (same signal)
- **Action**: **Reverse** the signal (BUY → SELL, SELL → BUY)
- **Purpose**: Generate opposite signals when indicators agree

**Reverse Rule (Fixed)**:
- **Condition**: When both wave indicators agree (same signal)
- **Action**: **Preserve** the signal (BUY → BUY, SELL → SELL)
- **Purpose**: Generate same signals when indicators agree

### Signal Values
- **BUY**: `1.0`
- **SELL**: `2.0`
- **NOTRADE**: `0.0`

### Test Results Comparison

**Before Fix**:
```
Prime result: [1. 2. 1. 2. 1.]  # Preserved signals
Reverse result: [2. 1. 2. 1. 2.]  # Inverted signals
Original signals: [1. 2. 1. 2. 1.]
```

**After Fix**:
```
Prime result: [2. 1. 2. 1. 2.]  # Inverted signals ✅
Reverse result: [1. 2. 1. 2. 1.]  # Preserved signals ✅
Original signals: [1. 2. 1. 2. 1.]
```

## Usage Example

### Command
```bash
uv run python -m src.cli.cli csv --csv-file data.csv --point 20 --rule wave:339,10,2,fast,22,11,4,fast,prime,10,close -d mpl
```

### Parameter Breakdown
- `wave:339,10,2,fast,22,11,4,fast,prime,10,close`
  - `339`: First long period
  - `10`: First fast period
  - `2`: First trend period
  - `fast`: First trading rule
  - `22`: Second long period
  - `11`: Second fast period
  - `4`: Second trend period
  - `fast`: Second trading rule
  - `prime`: **Global trading rule (now correctly inverts signals)**
  - `10`: SMA period
  - `close`: Price type

### Expected Behavior
- **Prime Rule**: When both wave indicators agree on a BUY signal, generate a SELL signal (and vice versa)
- **Contrarian Trading**: Provides opposite signals for potential reversal trading opportunities
