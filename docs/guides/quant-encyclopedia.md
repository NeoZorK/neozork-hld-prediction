## Metrics Categories

### Core Performance Metrics

- **Win Ratio** 🎯 - Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor** 💰 - Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Risk/Reward Ratio** ⚖️ - Average win size divided by average loss size

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

- **Sharpe Ratio** 📈 - Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Sortino Ratio** 📊 - Downside risk-adjusted return
- **Calmar Ratio** ⚡ - Return per unit of maximum risk

### Risk Management

- **Maximum Drawdown** 📉 - Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Volatility** 📊 - Standard deviation of returns
- **Risk of Ruin** 💀 - Probability of losing entire capital

### Position Sizing

- **Kelly Fraction** 🎲 - Optimal fraction of capital to risk per trade

### Performance

- **Total Return** 📈 - Overall percentage return
- **Net Return** 💵 - Return after trading costs

### Strategy Quality

- **Strategy Efficiency** ⚙️ - Net return as percentage of gross return
- **Break-Even Win Rate** ⚖️ - Minimum win rate for profitability

## Tips Categories

### Performance Tips

- **Win Rate Optimization** 🎯 - How to improve win rates effectively
- **Profit Factor Optimization** 💰 - Maximizing profit factor

### Risk Management

- **Risk Management Excellence** 🛡️ - Best practices for risk control
- **Position Sizing Mastery** 📏 - Optimal position sizing strategies

### Advanced Analysis

- **Monte Carlo Analysis** 🎲 - Using Monte Carlo simulations
- **Backtesting Best Practices** 🔬 - Proper backtesting methodology

### Machine Learning

- **Neural Network Strategies** 🧠 - Using neural networks in trading
- **Deep Learning for Trading** 🤖 - Advanced ML techniques

### Strategy Development

## Key Insights

### Win Rate Reality

> **Higher win rate is NOT always better!**
> 
> Reality: 1:3 risk/reward with 50% win rate outperforms 80% win rate with 1:1 risk/reward
> 
> Focus on risk-adjusted returns, not just win percentage.

### Profit Factor Importance

> **Profit factor is more important than win rate**
> 
> A 40% win rate with 2:1 profit factor beats 80% win rate with 1:1
> 
> Let winners run and cut losses quickly.

### Risk Management

> **Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade**
> 
> Preserves capital for compound growth
> 
> Calculate position size: (Account Size × Risk %) / Stop Loss Distance

### Kelly Criterion

> **Kelly Criterion provides optimal position sizing**
> 
> Mathematically maximizes long-term growth rate
> 
> Use 1/4 to 1/2 of full Kelly for safety margin

## Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Profit Factor

```bash
python run_analysis.py --metric profit factor
```

This will show:
- Detailed explanation of profit factor
- Formula: Gross Profit / Gross Loss
- Good range: 1.5-2.0
- Excellent range: >2.0
- Warning range: <1.0
- Strategy impact and tips

### Example 2: Win Rate Optimization

```bash
python run_analysis.py --metric tips winrate
```

This will show:
- Win rate optimization tips
- Reality check about win rates vs risk/reward
- Optimal win rate ranges
- How to improve win rates
- Managing losses effectively

### Example 3: Monte Carlo Analysis

```bash
python run_analysis.py --metric tips monte carlo
```

This will show:
- Monte Carlo analysis best practices
- Running 10,000+ simulations
- Focus on 95% confidence intervals
- Testing across market conditions
- Including transaction costs
