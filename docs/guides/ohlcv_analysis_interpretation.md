- **Good for**: Analysis with caution, may need data cleaning
- **Action**: Investigate and fix price relationship problems

### ‚ùå Poor (0-49% valid rows)
- **What it means**: Major data quality issues, unreliable for trading analysis

## Volume Analysis Status

### ‚úÖ Perfect (0% zero volumes)
- **What it means**: All trading periods have volume data
- **Good for**: Complete market activity picture
- **Action**: No action needed

### ‚úÖ Good (1-5% zero volumes)
- **What it means**: Very few periods with missing volume
- **Good for**: Reliable volume analysis
- **Action**: Minor data cleaning may be beneficial

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable (6-15% zero volumes)
- **What it means**: Some periods lack volume data
- **Good for**: Analysis with caution, may affect volume-based indicators
- **Action**: Consider filling missing volume data

### ‚ùå Problematic (>15% zero volumes)
- **What it means**: Significant volume data gaps
- **Good for**: Requires attention before volume analysis
- **Action**: Investigate data source, fill missing volumes

## Data Quality Status

### ‚úÖ Excellent (99-100% completeness)
- **What it means**: Almost no missing data points
- **Good for**: High-confidence analysis
- **Action**: No action needed

### ‚úÖ Very Good (95-98% completeness)
- **What it means**: Very few missing data points
- **Good for**: Reliable analysis with minor gaps
- **Action**: Consider filling small gaps

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Good (90-94% completeness)
- **What it means**: Some missing data, but generally complete
- **Good for**: Analysis with caution
- **Action**: Review and address missing data

### üî∂ Fair (80-89% completeness)
- **What it means**: Significant data gaps
- **Good for**: Limited analysis reliability
- **Action**: Data cleaning required

### ‚ùå Poor (<80% completeness)
- **What it means**: Major data gaps, unreliable
- **Good for**: Requires immediate attention
- **Action**: Data source review and cleaning needed

## Price-Volume Correlation Status

### ‚úÖ Strong Positive (0.7-1.0)
- **What it means**: Strong positive relationship between price and volume
- **Good for**: Volume confirms price movements
- **Trading insight**: High volume supports price trends

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Strong Negative (-0.7 to -1.0)
- **What it means**: Strong negative relationship (volume up when price down)
- **Good for**: Contrarian signals, potential reversals
- **Trading insight**: High volume may indicate trend exhaustion

### ‚úÖ Moderate Positive (0.3-0.7)
- **What it means**: Moderate positive correlation
- **Good for**: Some volume confirmation of price moves
- **Trading insight**: Volume provides some trend confirmation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Negative (-0.3 to -0.7)
- **What it means**: Moderate negative correlation
- **Good for**: Mixed signals, requires other indicators
- **Trading insight**: Volume patterns may contradict price trends

### üî∂ Weak (0.1-0.3 or -0.1 to -0.3)
- **What it means**: Weak correlation between price and volume
- **Good for**: Limited volume confirmation
- **Trading insight**: Volume less reliable for trend confirmation

### üî∂ Negligible (-0.1 to 0.1)
- **What it means**: No meaningful correlation
- **Good for**: Volume doesn't predict price movements
- **Trading insight**: Focus on other indicators, volume less relevant

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Data
```
Price Validation: 100.0% valid rows ‚úÖ Excellent
Volume Analysis: 0.0% zero volumes ‚úÖ Perfect
Data Quality: 100.0% completeness ‚úÖ Excellent
Price-Volume Correlation: 0.650 (Moderate positive) ‚úÖ
```
**Interpretation**: High-quality data, reliable for all types of analysis.

### Scenario 2: Indicator Data
```
Price Validation: 0.0% valid rows ‚ùå Poor
Volume Analysis: 0.0% zero volumes ‚úÖ Perfect
Data Quality: 100.0% completeness ‚úÖ Excellent
Price-Volume Correlation: 0.078 (Negligible positive) üî∂
```
**Interpretation**: This is likely indicator data (RSI, MACD, etc.) where OHLC validation doesn't apply. Focus on the indicator values rather than price relationships.

### Scenario 3: Problematic Data
```
Price Validation: 45.0% valid rows ‚ùå Poor
Volume Analysis: 25.0% zero volumes ‚ùå Problematic
Data Quality: 75.0% completeness ‚ùå Poor
Price-Volume Correlation: -0.150 (Negligible negative) üî∂
```
**Interpretation**: Major data quality issues. Requires immediate cleaning before analysis.

## Recommendations by Status

### For Excellent/Perfect Status
- Proceed with confidence
- Use for all types of analysis
- No immediate action needed

### For Good Status
- Generally reliable
- Minor improvements possible
- Monitor for changes

### For Fair Status
- Use with caution
- Consider data cleaning
- Supplement with other data sources

### For Poor Status
- Immediate attention required
- Clean data before analysis
- Review data source quality

## Best Practices

1. **Always check Price Validation first** - This is the foundation of reliable analysis
2. **Volume Analysis matters for trading** - Zero volumes can indicate data issues
3. **Data Quality affects everything** - Poor completeness reduces reliability
4. **Correlation provides context** - Understanding price-volume relationships helps with strategy development
5. **Combine multiple indicators** - Don't rely on single metrics for decisions

## Troubleshooting

### If Price Validation is Poor
- Check if data is actually OHLC (not indicators)
- Verify data source quality
- Look for data transformation issues

### If Volume Analysis is Problematic
- Check for missing trading days
- Verify volume data source
- Consider if asset has irregular trading

### If Data Quality is Poor
- Identify missing data patterns
- Check data source reliability
- Consider data interpolation

### If Correlation is Unexpected
- Verify both price and volume data quality
- Check for data alignment issues
- Consider market conditions (some assets have naturally low correlation)
