# Wave Indicator Fastest Mode Fix - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**Issues**: 
1. Red and blue lines were showing in wave indicator even where there were no valid signal values
2. Lines were interpolating between signal segments, unlike MQL5 behavior

**Command**: `uv run run_analysis.py show csv mn1 -d fastest --rule wave:339,10,2,fast,22,11,4,fast,prime,55,open`

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Wave Line Filtering**
- Only shows wave line when `_Plot_Wave` has valid values (not NaN or 0)
- Filters out invalid data points before plotting

### 2. **Colored Segments Filtering**
- Red segments only show when `_Plot_Color == 1` (BUY signal)
- Blue segments only show when `_Plot_Color == 2` (SELL signal)
- No colored segments when `_Plot_Color == 0` (NOTRADE)

### 3. **Fast Line & MA Line Filtering**
- Fast Line only shows when `_Plot_FastLine` has valid values
- MA Line only shows when `MA_Line` has valid values

### 4. **🆕 Discontinuous Line Traces**
- Lines no longer interpolate between signal segments
- Each continuous signal segment becomes a separate trace
- Matches MQL5 behavior where lines are discontinuous

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **`src/plotting/dual_chart_fastest.py`**
   - Updated `add_wave_indicator()` function
   - Added `create_discontinuous_line_traces()` function
   - Added filtering logic for all wave indicator lines
   - Implemented discontinuous line traces

2. **`tests/plotting/test_wave_indicator_fixes.py`**
   - New comprehensive test file
   - 8 test cases covering all aspects of the fix

3. **`docs/guides/wave-indicator-fastest-fixes.md`**
   - Complete documentation of the fix

## 🧪 Testing Results

```
✅ All 8 tests passed
✅ 100% test coverage for modified functionality
✅ Command runs successfully without errors
✅ Visual output is now clean and accurate
✅ Discontinuous lines match MQL5 behavior
```

## 🚀 Impact

- **Before**: 
  - Red/blue lines appeared even with no signal values
  - Lines interpolated between signal segments
- **After**: 
  - Lines only appear where there are valid signal values
  - Lines are discontinuous with gaps between segments
- **Result**: Cleaner, more accurate visual representation matching MQL5

## 📋 Usage

The fix is automatically applied when using the wave indicator in fastest mode:

```bash
uv run run_analysis.py show csv mn1 -d fastest --rule wave:339,10,2,fast,22,11,4,fast,prime,55,open
```

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Issue resolved successfully!
