# Data Analysis Workflow: Feature Generation, Correlation Analysis, and Feature Importance

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended sequence for conducting comprehensive data analysis in the Neozork HLD Prediction project, focusing on feature generation, correlation analysis, and feature importance analysis.

## Recommended Analysis Sequence

### 1. Feature Generation (First Step)

**Why First:**
- Creates the foundation for all subsequent analysis
- Generates "raw material" from original data
- Without features, correlation and importance analysis cannot be performed

**What It Includes:**
- Technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Statistical features (volatility, skewness, kurtosis)
- Momentum features (ROC, Momentum)
- Price-based features (returns, price changes)
- Volume features

**Implementation:**
```python
# Using existing FeatureEngineer
features = feature_engineer.generate_features(
    market_data, 
    feature_types=['technical', 'statistical', 'momentum', 'price', 'volume']
)
```

### 2. Correlation Analysis (Second Step)

**Why After Feature Generation:**
- Analyzes relationships between all generated features
- Identifies multicollinearity (high correlation between features)
- Determines which features duplicate each other

**What It Includes:**
- Pearson correlation matrix
- Multicollinearity analysis
- Identification of highly correlated feature pairs
- Recommendations for removing redundant features

**Implementation:**
```python
# Using existing correlation analysis tools
correlation_analysis = correlation_analyzer.analyze_correlations(
    features, 
    methods=['pearson', 'spearman']
)
```

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis (Third Step)

**Why Last:**
- Evaluates each feature's contribution to the target variable
- Identifies most informative features
- Selects optimal feature set for modeling

**What It Includes:**
- Random Forest feature importance
- XGBoost feature importance
- Mutual information analysis
- Statistical significance tests
- Feature selection

**Implementation:**
```python
# Using existing FeatureSelector
importance_analysis = feature_importance_analyzer.analyze_importance(
    features, 
    target=target_variable,
    methods=['random_forest', 'xgboost', 'mutual_info']
)
```

## Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Generate features
features = feature_engineer.generate_features(
    market_data, 
    feature_types=['technical', 'statistical', 'momentum', 'price', 'volume']
)

# 2. Analyze correlations
correlation_analysis = correlation_analyzer.analyze_correlations(
    features, 
    methods=['pearson', 'spearman']
)

# 3. Analyze feature importance
importance_analysis = feature_importance_analyzer.analyze_importance(
    features, 
    target=target_variable,
    methods=['random_forest', 'xgboost', 'mutual_info']
)
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Available Components

1. **Feature Generation:**
   - `FeatureEngineer` class in `src/pocket_hedge_fund/advanced_analytics/core/feature_engineer.py`
   - `RealMLModels.create_features()` in `src/ml/real_ml_models.py`

2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - `MultiMarketManager.get_cross_market_analysis()` in `src/global/multi_market_integration.py`
   - `QuantitativeResearcher.analyze_correlations()` in `src/research/quantitative_research.py`

3. **Feature Importance:**
   - `FeatureSelector` class in `src/pocket_hedge_fund/advanced_analytics/ml/feature_selector.py`
   - `PricePredictor._get_feature_importance()` in `src/pocket_hedge_fund/ml/price_predictor.py`

### Integration Points

- **Statistical Analysis:** `stat_analysis.py`
- **Time Series Analysis:** `time_analysis.py`
- **Financial Analysis:** `finance_analysis.py`

## Data Storage Structure

```
data/
├── fixed/
│   ├── features/           # Generated features
│   ├── correlations/       # Correlation matrices
│   └── feature_importance/ # Importance analysis results
├── analysis/
│   ├── feature_generation/ # Feature generation reports
│   ├── correlation_analysis/ # Correlation analysis reports
│   └── importance_analysis/ # Feature importance reports
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clean Data:**
   - Use data from `data/fixed/` directory
   - Ensure data quality before feature generation

2. **Iterative Process:**
   - Generate features → Analyze correlations → Remove redundant features
   - Repeat until optimal feature set is achieved

3. **Documentation:**
   - Save all intermediate results
   - Maintain metadata for reproducibility
   - Document feature engineering decisions

4. **Validation:**
   - Cross-validate feature importance results
   - Test correlation stability over time
   - Monitor feature performance in models

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Feature Generation:**
   - Comprehensive set of technical, statistical, and momentum features
   - Properly formatted and validated feature data

2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Identification of redundant features
   - Recommendations for feature reduction
   - Understanding of feature relationships

3. **Feature Importance:**
   - Ranked list of most important features
   - Optimal feature subset for modeling
   - Feature selection recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Implement the workflow using existing project components
2. Create automated pipelines for the analysis sequence
3. Develop visualization tools for each analysis step
4. Integrate with the existing analysis tools (`stat_analysis.py`, `time_analysis.py`, `finance_analysis.py`)
