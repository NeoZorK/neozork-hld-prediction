# Time Series Gaps Analysis Fix

## Problem Description

The Time Series Gaps Analysis (option 1 in EDA menu) was analyzing ALL data files in the `data/` directory and subdirectories instead of only analyzing the preloaded data from the interactive system.

## Root Cause

The `run_time_series_gaps_analysis` method in `EDAAnalyzer` was:
1. Scanning the entire `data/` directory for files
2. Loading and analyzing every CSV/parquet file found
3. Ignoring the fact that data was already loaded into `system.current_data`

## Solution

Modified the method to:
1. **Only analyze preloaded data** from `system.current_data`
2. **Analyze cross-timeframe data** if available in `system.timeframe_info`
3. **Skip file system scanning** entirely
4. **Provide better reporting** showing which datasets contain gaps

## Changes Made

### File: `src/interactive/eda_analyzer.py`

- **Method**: `run_time_series_gaps_analysis()`
- **Before**: Scanned all files in `data/` directory
- **After**: Analyzes only `system.current_data` and cross-timeframe data

### Key Changes:

1. **Data Source Check**: Now checks if `system.current_data` exists
2. **Main Dataset Analysis**: Analyzes the currently loaded dataset
3. **Cross-Timeframe Analysis**: Analyzes additional timeframes if available
4. **Improved Reporting**: Shows gaps by dataset type (main vs cross-timeframe)

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: No more scanning entire file system
2. **Relevance**: Only analyzes data that user actually loaded
3. **Consistency**: Matches behavior of other EDA functions
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication of what data is being analyzed

## Testing

- Updated unit tests to reflect new behavior
- All tests pass (11/11 for gaps analysis, 132/139 for interactive system)
- Tests now mock `system.current_data` and `timeframe_info` instead of file system

## Usage

1. Load data using main menu option 1
2. Go to EDA menu (option 2)
3. Select Time Series Gaps Analysis (option 1)
4. Analysis will run only on preloaded data

## Backward Compatibility

- No breaking changes to public API
- Method signature remains the same
- Only internal implementation changed
