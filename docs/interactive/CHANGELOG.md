# Interactive System Changelog

## [2025-09-03] - Time Series Gaps Analysis Fix

### Fixed
- **Time Series Gaps Analysis** now analyzes only preloaded data instead of scanning all files in `data/` directory
- **Cross-timeframe data analysis** now works correctly with in-memory DataFrames instead of trying to load non-existent files
- Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary file system scanning
- Better user experience with clear indication of what data is being analyzed

### Changed
- `EDAAnalyzer.run_time_series_gaps_analysis()` method now works with `system.current_data` and `system.other_timeframes_data`
- Analysis reports now show gaps by dataset type (main vs cross-timeframe) with appropriate source information
- Method signature remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- Gracefully handles both file-based and in-memory data sources

### Technical Details
- **File**: `src/interactive/eda_analyzer.py`
- **Method**: `run_time_series_gaps_analysis()`
- **Tests**: Updated to reflect new behavior (12/12 passing)
- **Coverage**: All interactive system tests passing (133/140)

### Benefits
1. **Performance**: No more scanning entire file system
2. **Relevance**: Only analyzes data that user actually loaded
3. **Consistency**: Matches behavior of other EDA functions
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication of what data is being analyzed
5. **Reliability**: No more errors from trying to load non-existent files

### Usage
1. Load data using main menu option 1
2. Go to EDA menu (option 2)
3. Select Time Series Gaps Analysis (option 1)
4. Analysis will run only on preloaded data:
   - Main dataset from `system.current_data`
   - Cross-timeframe data from `system.other_timeframes_data` (if available)

### Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to public API
- Method signature remains the same
- Only internal implementation changed
- Gracefully handles both old and new data structures
